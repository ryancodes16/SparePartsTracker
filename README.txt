This project was a python script that used SQLITE3 as a database. It took in parts and made an inventory within the database.

Features: 
-Windows Application
-Search for certain part or see all the parts in the inventory
-Update parts
-Add parts

Features that were to come before it was decommissioned:
-use py2exe to make an .exe file
-add GUI with Tkinter
-Uploaded to company internal server on my website


****Development paused and possibly done forever on this project****
****See the Spart Parts tracking website which reuses a lot of this code****
****Feel free to fork or use any of this code for your own project :)****
